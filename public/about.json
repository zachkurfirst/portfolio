  "bio": "Hi, I'm Zach! For 8 years, I worked as a technical solutions specialist, where I owned a variety of projects during my time at Ultra Music Festival and Mana Common -- such as the management and development of countless website domains, and the implementation and execution of various SaaS solutions. I recently completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program, where I learned a diverse range of programming languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, Python, React, Express, and Django. I created four projects along the way, each of which you can check out below!",
  "wrap": "I'm driven by the desire to help others solve challenging problems, learn modern software solutions, and optimize their everyday work. I'm excited to now merge my prior experience with my newfound technical skillset as I navigate the dynamic realm of software engineering!"
